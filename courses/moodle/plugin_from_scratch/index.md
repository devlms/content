As a new Moodle developer back in 2016. The first thing I searched for is "How to createa  Moodle plugin from scratch." Luckly, there was the moodle documentation. It has some pages where they explain what files are needed, and how to bring your plugin to life. However, they weren't convering the whole process. When you check existing plugins' code. You will get confused most of the time. Since not all plugins in the marketplace adhere to the code of conduct and best practices stated in the documentation. My thought on that, is that Moodle marketplace before they have rules accepted lots of plugins that are being used. So, when you check on most famous plugins, you get confused and won't move forward.

This course, will explore the creation of a general purpose Moodle plugin from scratch step by step.
